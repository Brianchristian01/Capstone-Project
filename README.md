# Capstone-Project
## Filtering Resumes by Job Category using MULTI LABEL TEXT CLASSIFICATION AND Topic Modelling (NLP)

### Agenda
> To help improve the company’s job search algorithm by putting resumes into their respective categories. The current accuracy is around 75%.


> Expand the “others” category in their job categories by filling it with newer job categories.



> Extract expertise level from resume titles and descriptions.


### Libraries and Algorithms used
* **NLTK, sPaCy, Gensim, LDA ALgorithm** 
* **Algorithms used in the multilabel classification:** Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Support Vector, K Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes, Xgboost Classifier, LightGBM Classifier, CatBoost Classifier.

### Final Result 
> **The LightGBM classifier's accuracy is 85.48% which is 10% more than the current company accuracy**_.
